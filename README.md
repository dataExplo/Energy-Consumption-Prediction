# Energy-Consumption-Prediction

Energy consumption is a critical aspect of modern life, impacting everything from individual households to large-scale industrial operations. Understanding and predicting energy consumption patterns can lead to more efficient energy use and significant cost savings. In this notebook, we will explore a dataset that captures various factors influencing energy consumption, such as temperature, humidity, and occupancy. Our goal is to uncover insights and potentially develop a predictive model for energy consumption.
